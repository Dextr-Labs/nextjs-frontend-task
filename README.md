### Frontend Engineer Take-Home Task: Building Uniswap-like Feature with React and Next.js

Objective:
The goal of this take-home task is to assess your skills in building a front-end interface using React and Next.js, particularly focusing on implementing functionality similar to Uniswap, a decentralized exchange for cryptocurrencies. You will be expected to create a simplified version of the swapping feature found in Uniswap.

Instructions:
You are required to build a web application that allows users to swap between two cryptocurrencies. The application should be built using React and Next.js for server-side rendering. While the functionality will be simplified compared to Uniswap, it should mimic the core swapping feature.

Requirements:
1. **Homepage:**
   - A landing page with a brief introduction to the swapping functionality.
   - Navigation to the swapping page.

2. **Swapping Page:**
   - Display two input fields for selecting the cryptocurrencies to swap.
   - Input fields should include dropdowns or auto-suggest functionality for selecting the cryptocurrencies.
   - Allow users to input the amount they want to swap.
   - Display the estimated amount of the other cryptocurrency the user will receive after the swap, based on the current exchange rate.
   - Implement a swap button to execute the transaction.
   - Show appropriate error/success messages during the swapping process.

3. **API Integration:**
   - Utilize cryptocurrency price data from a public API (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap) to fetch real-time exchange rates.
   - Implement the necessary API calls to fetch cryptocurrency data and exchange rates.

4. **User Experience:**
   - Ensure a smooth and responsive user interface.
   - Implement loading indicators during API requests.
   - Validate user inputs and provide clear error messages if inputs are invalid.

5. **Optional Enhancements (Bonus):**
   - Implement transaction history to show the previous swaps.
   - Add support for more cryptocurrencies.
   - Implement a simple user authentication system.
   - Add visual enhancements such as animations or transitions.

Guidelines:
- You are free to use any libraries or frameworks that you find appropriate.
- Design and styling are important but not the primary focus. You can use existing UI libraries like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for quicker styling.
- Make sure your code is well-structured, maintainable, and follows best practices.
- Write clear comments wherever necessary to explain your code.
- Provide instructions on how to run your application locally.

Submission:
- Send a GitHub repository link containing your code.
- Include a README file with clear instructions on how to run the application and any additional information you deem necessary.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Functionality: Does the application meet the specified requirements?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
- User Experience: Is the application intuitive and user-friendly?
- API Integration: Is real-time cryptocurrency data accurately fetched and displayed?
- Bonus Points: Any additional features or enhancements beyond the basic requirements.

Note: This task is designed to simulate real-world development scenarios and showcase your skills as a frontend engineer with React and Next.js experience. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. Good luck!
